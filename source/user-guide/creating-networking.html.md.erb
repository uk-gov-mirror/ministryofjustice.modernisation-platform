## Overview

In the Modernisation Platform, we provide the core networking resources that you will need for your application.

For each account there are networking resources that we provide as standard, and additional resources that can be added if needed.

These are defined in JSON files in the [environment-networks](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/tree/main/environments-networks) directory.

The Modernisation Platform will work with you to create these files and assign you VPC and subnet CIDR ranges.

### Standard resources

#### VPC

VPC ([AWS Virtual Private Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/)), providing out of the box network isolation.

#### Subnet Set

Three different subnet types spread across all three availability zones (eu-west-2a, eu-west-2b, eu-west2c), making a total of nine subnets:

 * Public (for public resources such as load balancers)
 * Private (for private resources such as application servers)
 * Data (for data resources such as databases)

#### DNS Zones

Hosted public and private DNS zones for your application domain names.

#### Certificate Services

Amazon issued public certificates and a subordinate private CA for private certificates.

### Additional networking resources

#### Connectivity to other VPCs

As default your VPC is isolated, if you need connectivity to other VPCs this can be created.

#### Linux Bastion

Connecting to servers should be done via [AWS Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-sessions-start.html), but if it is not possible to install the SSM agent due to the age of the operating system, then a secure bastion server can be provisioned.

#### Additional Endpoints

#### Extended DNS

### Additional resources

You can view our architecture for Networking on the [dedicated Networking architecture page](../concepts/networking), which also explains what you get by doing this.
